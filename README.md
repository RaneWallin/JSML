# JSML
Machine Learning Algorithms in Javascript. 

## Introduction
This is a project to translate common machine learning algorithms into Javascript. The purpose of this is to fully learn and understand these algorithms for my personal use. I will make them available here for anyone who may also be interested.

## Sources
My initial introduction to machine learning with Javascript is through the [Machine Learning with Javascript](https://www.udemy.com/machine-learning-with-javascript/) course on Udemy. Once completing this, I will move on to a machine learning algorithms book. I currently have the [Machine Learning Algorithms](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/machine-learning-algorithms) by Packt from a [Humble Bundle](https://www.humblebundle.com/). I will work with it, as long as it seems like a reasonable book once I get into it. If needed, I will explore other options.

## Methods
Once I have finished the Udemy course, I will work through the Packt book. The Packt book uses Python (as do most other ML resources). My current experience with Python is limited, so this will also allow me to strengthen those skills. My hope/intention is to do regular write ups or blog posts on what I am doing and what my thoughts are.
